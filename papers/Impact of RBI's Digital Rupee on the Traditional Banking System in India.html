   <p><strong>Abstract: </strong>This research examines the introduction and implications of the Digital Rupee (CBDC) by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) within the context of India's evolving financial landscape. As a digital currency issued by the central bank, the Digital Rupee holds significant potential for enhancing financial inclusion, improving payment efficiency, and facilitating more effective monetary policy. However, its adoption has been slower compared to existing digital payment systems such as UPI, with only a modest increase in user and merchant participation, highlighting key challenges such as public awareness, trust, and infrastructure readiness. This study investigates the operational, regulatory, and policy challenges posed by the Digital Rupee, including risks to the traditional banking system, potential disintermediation of banks, and the increased competition from the RBI in the payment services sector. The research also explores the impact of the Digital Rupee on monetary policy, liquidity management, and its potential to reach unbanked populations, offering promising prospects for financial inclusion, particularly in rural and underserved areas. Additionally, the research draws global comparisons, considering the experiences of countries like China, to better understand the hurdles and opportunities for CBDC adoption. The study concludes by offering recommendations for banks, regulators, and policymakers to foster a supportive environment for the Digital Rupee, ensuring its success while addressing the challenges of security, privacy, and financial stability. Ultimately, this research aims toprovide insights into the transformative potential of the Digital Rupee in shaping India's digital financial ecosystem.  citation: Mujawar, M. S. N., & Shinde, S.
